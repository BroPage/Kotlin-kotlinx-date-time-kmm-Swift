Hi BroPage here, and I LOVE Android Studio and Kotlin but just do not know that much about iOS and Swift. So when I was requested 
to make my Android app available on iOS devices I was faced with two major issues. They where Date processing and a new GUI interface. 
This app is the beginning of this journey to a MPP developer.

I am starting this community to talk about the process of making the transition from an Android based software developer to a Multiple
Platform Mobile(MPM) development environment using the Android Studio. For me to begin this journey I need to understand now I was going to 
overcome the Date Time differences between the two systems. I also needed to learn how to develop a GUI on the iOS system.

This example app has allowed me to accomplish both of the basic requirements listed above. I have used Kotlin Date Time that is operating
system independent. I included that routine in the common sections of a Kotlin Multiplatform Moble(KMM) app created with Android Studio. I
then created a very simple Android GUI to display the data created by that routine. My last step was to display that data in just as simple
a way on an Apple Phone or Tablet.

I am looking for ideas, suggestions' or improvements to the code I created to help others who are trying to make this journey.

Minimum requirement Android Studio 4.1, 
Run and tested on iOS BigSur and the one just before that release.

Please see the recomendations in the "documentation" directory to you get started with an iOS system if you do not have an iOS development
environment.
